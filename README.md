This is a program to drive a battlebot around. It uses Bluetooth sockets in order to communicate with an on-board computer, sending UTF-8 encoded strings each 1/6 of a second. twoMotors.py is a manual control module, which drives the bot from the arrow keys on the keyboard. selfdrivewithroi.py is a control algorithm using computer vision, which takes in a live webcam footage of two robots in a ring, and outputs commands to control the robot via on-board computer. This code works, but is not currently formatted with understandable comments and structure.
